### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm ClÃ©ment

I'm a self-taught web developer. I'm currently employed as Lead Dev in a web agency near Poitiers, France, but I'm also open to some freelance work. Feel free to contact me. Apart from programming languages, I'm fluent in French, Spanish & English (and still learning Portuguese).

#### My journey ðŸ§­

I started coding at age 11, with automation scripts for MS Excel, VBS & Batch files, at 13 I began to learn HTML, CSS & PHP, and at 15 I began to learn Python and to use Linux and FLOSS on a daily basis.

I have a DIY/handcrafted/old-tech/low-tech approach of development & tech in general. Over the years, I have created a lot of softwares & web apps (ranging from the almost useful to the amusing), such as a Python keyboard-to-series-port Morse converter, a PHP rotoscopic video processor, a WASM/OpenCV video to audio synth, or a Python markov-chain-based image generator. I've also spent a lot of time coding [PureData](https://puredata.info/) patches. Unfortunately, many of these projects are old and now only live on some backup disk somewhere in the attic. Luckily at some point I started to use Git in my coding projects!  

Here are a few things you can find in my public repos, which mainly have 2 focus: arts in general and often music/sound processing in particular (I've studied musicology for 5 years), and library science (before being Lead Dev, I've been working for two years at [OpenEdition](https://www.openedition.org) as Metadata Officer and then Fullstack dev). 

* Books & Library Science:
    * [JsMARC](https://github.com/corbin-c/jsmarc): browser/npm module/node cli tool to read/filter/parse [MARC](https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/) files, used by libraries to describe books
    * [WebZ3950](https://github.com/corbin-c/web-z3950): binding to access [Z39.50 protocol](https://www.niso.org/publications/ansiniso-z3950-2003-s2014) over HTTP. Z39.50 is an old protocol used by libraries to share & query their catalogues
    * [BACON Utility](https://github.com/corbin-c/bacon-helper): a simple web interface to query the French Knowledge Base known as [BACON](https://bacon.abes.fr/) and retrieve [KBART data](https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/kbart)
    * [Biblio Jeunesse](https://github.com/corbin-c/biblio-jeunesse): a catalogue of literature for the youth. This static website was built using an ODT file containing a list of books, which was parsed and enriched using a series of NodeJS scripts to query APIs & SPARQL endpoints
    * [Wiki-tree](https://github.com/corbin-c/wiki-tree): web interface to graphically browse Wikipedia, exploring relations between articles and their taxonomy 
* Arts & music:
    * [Pixel-SVG](https://github.com/corbin-c/pixel-svg): simple tool to perform vectorization over raster images in order to pixelate them.
    * [Audioviz](https://github.com/corbin-c/audioviz): web audio api experiment to visualize audio signal as svg.
    * [Leon](https://github.com/corbin-c/leon): another webaudio api experiment to produce sound based on a device orientation.
    * [Polysynth.js](https://github.com/corbin-c/polySynth.js): yet another webaudio api experiment
    * [Movie Picker](https://github.com/corbin-c/movie-picker): a simple "movie picker" web app, based on IMDB data, deployed on Heroku.
    * [Jukeberry](https://github.com/corbin-c/jukeberry): using a Raspberry Pi as a Media center, remotely controlled by a web app.
